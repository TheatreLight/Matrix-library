# Matrix library

Library for working with matrices.

There are implemented:
1. Arythmetic operations like +, -, *, multiplication by number;
2. Operation comparison: equality matrices;
3. Mathematic operations like transpose, calculation of complements, determinant, inverse matrix;
4. Overloaded operators of increment and dectrement, *=, ==;
5. Overloaded operator() - access to each element by index;

1. make - build a static library and run tests
2. gcov_report - create a report about covering functions
3. make check - code style and cppcheck
